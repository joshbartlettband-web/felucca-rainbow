/* RAINBOW MODE (FELUCCA_KID): the FM-1 as a toy for a small child. It is on from power-up; holding HOME and SAVE
 * together for 3 s leaves it for the full Felucca until the next power-up.
 *   Keys        play the friend's sound; the band shows the note's letter, big, in its colour (C red, D orange,
 *               E yellow, F green, G teal, A purple, B pink, as the coloured bells and tubes of music classes),
 *               and the friend hops
 *   PRESETS     the next / previous friend (58, each a picture, a sound, a home sky and a favourite beat:
 *               tools/gen_kid_art.py, KID_SOUND)
 *   ALGORITHM   how the keys play, a step a turn, each with a picture: 1 FRIEND, 3 FRIENDS (a key plays a chord in
 *               key), STRUM (an Omnichord: black keys pick a chord, white keys strum it), ACCORDION (a black key plays
 *               its chord, white keys their own notes), GUESS (an ear game: a friend sings a note,
 *               the child finds it), FOLLOW (songs to learn: the next key lights, SEQ the next song). Keys held together
 *               show their letters in their colours and the chord's name
 *   SELECT      the beat slower / faster
 *   KNOB 1      big / small: the octave (low notes, a big friend; high notes, a small one); OCT- / OCT+ too
 *   KNOB 2      day / night: the sky, the sun and the moon, and the sound gets darker (FX filter)
 *   KNOB 3      echo: delay and reverb, and copies of the friend that follow it
 *   KNOB 4      wiggle: vibrato, and the friend wobbles
 *   FX SCL ENV LFO EDIT GLO   a tap turns one on (its light lit), another tap off: HICCUP (repeat), BACKWARDS,
 *               SLEEPY (tape stop; it wakes up by itself), SQUEAKY (an octave up), GIANT (an octave down), FREEZE:
 *               Felucca's performance effects (perform.c), and the friend shakes, turns round, droops and dozes,
 *               shrinks, grows, turns to ice
 *   PLAY        the beat: drums (track 4) and a bass line in key (track 2), the friend dances to it; SEQ: the next
 *               of eleven beats
 *   ARP         sparkle: a held key plays up and down
 *   REC         the next sky (rainbow, stars, hearts, bubbles, flowers, confetti, clouds, snow, leaves, desert), with
 *               confetti
 *   HOME        a surprise friend
 *   SAVE        WRITE: the child writes a song on a big staff, each note a friend (kw_*, below); SAVE again, back
 *   THE STAFF   a treble clef drops in at the top when the child plays, and writes the notes as coloured noteheads, up to 8,
 *               chords stacked, sharps with a #, ledger lines, 8VA / 8VB over the staff for the octave (OCT); each
 *               note's value by how long it was held against the beat (a sixteenth .. a whole, growing while held);
 *               it goes after 6 s of quiet. The big letter stays in the band
 *   HOME held 1 s, then OCT- / OCT+   the grown-ups' VOLUME: how loud MASTER can go (8 steps, kept over power-off)
 *   HOME held 1 s, then ALGORITHM the grown-ups' NAME: the name the hello greets (PRESETS a letter, ALGORITHM the next,
 *                                 SAVE keeps it, HOME leaves it as it was), kept over power-off
 *   HOME held 1 s, then PRESETS   the grown-ups' LOOK-ALIKES: left shows original stand-ins for the friends drawn
 *               after TV and film characters (the same sounds), right the originals (kept over power-off)
 * MASTER is capped at that level (the default is about half) for small ears, and the output limiter's ceiling
 * follows it, so an effect cannot make the toy louder than a plain note (kid_master). Everything else (USB, MIDI,
 * the editor, the web installer) works as in the full Felucca.
 * The screen has no frame buffer: a changed area is drawn row strip by row strip into the two halves of the
 * canvas (gfx.c cv_px), one strip computed while the other goes to the panel. */
